## Window Manager Preservation Project (WMPP)

Welcome!  This project attempts to preserve the various window managers which
have been written since X11 was invented.  Although this was originally
specific to UNIX, this project takes in to account those window managers which
have since been created for XFree86/XOrg, where Linux was perhaps the main
focus.

Since `wm` on X10, there have been many WMs written.  Many WMs today largely
have [fvwm](https://www.fvwm.org) to thank, either in terms of being direct
forks, or as a reference point on how to manage troublesome windows.   Of
course, fvwm in turn has twm to thank.

### Goals

The goals of **WMPP** are to:

* Provide the canonical source code for WMs which are no longer in
  development;
* To maintain and ensure that the source code for any given WM added here
  compiles (ideally, warning free);
  * This could be achieved using Docker (for those OSes which support it) and
    https://github.com/mviereck/x11docker
* To provide a little bit of history around the WM;
* Maintain a family tree to show whether the WM was derived/forked from a
  previous WM

Over time, the family tree will grow and it may well be that it points to
active WMs/DEs, peripheral to this project.  That's a good thing.

But in all, it should be fun tracking these down.

### Similar Projects

Over the years there have been similar lists, such as:

- https://www.gilesorr.com/wm/table.html
- https://www.xwinman.org

These go only so far in helping to document and maintain the history that goes
along with them, often with dead links to sites which no longer have the
source code.

### Where to start?

Anywhere.  Ideally, look at what has been derived from fvwm first, as there've
been many and work from there.

Candidates:

- Afterstep
- Amiwm
- Bowman
- MGR
- WindowMaker
